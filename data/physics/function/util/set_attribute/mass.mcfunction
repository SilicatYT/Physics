# Update the local inverse inertia tensor (Scaling: InverseMass scaled by 1,000,000/x instead of 100,000,000/x)
# (Important): To prevent an overflow when squaring the dimension, I calculate <added squared dimensions / inversemass> at a scale where the added squared dimensions are 100x too small, but then instead of dividing by 12 after the division, I multiply by 833 and then divide by 100, so that the end result is scaled the same.
