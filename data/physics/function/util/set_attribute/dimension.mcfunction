# (Important) (TODO): Minor issue is that several scores like the bounding box min and max (and the step counts) are not updated when changing dimensions or when summoning the object in the first place, so it can't properly detect collisions in the first tick afterwards.

# Set the object's x, y and z dimensions (width, height and length)
# (Important): Because of the AABB check between world geometry and the object, the max dimensions are currently restricted to 4 blocks along each axis (Because there's currently 1 function for every single bounding box, which would be 350MB of data even for just 8x8x8 cubes)
