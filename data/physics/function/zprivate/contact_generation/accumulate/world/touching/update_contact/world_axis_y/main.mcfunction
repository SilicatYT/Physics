    # (Important): I project this contact's normal onto the current tick's contact's normal. If it's less than 70%, the contact is discarded completely for stability and performance reasons. If it's less than 90%, just carry over the contact without updating it (invalid contact).

# Check if the Contact Corner is within the hitbox
# (Important): This is necessary because the penetration depth could be positive even if the hitboxes aren't touching. So if they aren't touching, the contact should be ignored during resolution, but it should still be stored because we can't be sure whether the hitboxes are only slightly distanced or far away.
# (Important): A point is within a cuboid when the point's projections onto the cuboid's 3 axes all lie within the cuboid's min and max.
# (Important): If this check fails, the contact is still kept for later ticks, but it will be completely ignored during resolution.
# (Important): The contact point's y component is defined to be the min or max, so I don't have to check for that.
