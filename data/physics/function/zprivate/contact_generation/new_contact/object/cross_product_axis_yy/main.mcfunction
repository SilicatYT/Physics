# Calculate Penetration Depth, Contact Normal, Contact Point & Separating Velocity
    # Penetration Depth
    # (Important): For edge-edge collisions, the penetration depth is the distance between the two edges, but also the edges' projections subtracted from one another (bigger - smaller).
    # (Important): The calculations are done in "get_edge_b".

    # Contact Point
    # (Important): For edge-edge collisions, the contact point is the closest point on one edge to the other.
    # (Important): Calculation: Work with the edges as line definitions (starting point + variable * directional vector). Define the "squared distance" function and find its minimum (it's the only critical point, so setting the 1st derivative of the function to 0 is enough). I only calculate s for one edge, as I'm pretty sure it's guaranteed to correspond to a point that's within the edge's bounds. So I don't need a fallback for "If s is out of bounds, do the same for the other edge".
    # (Important): Edge1 = <Corner on the negative end> + s * <Corner on the positive end> => (u + s * v)    //    Edge2 = <Corner on the negative end> + t * <Corner on the positive end> => (m + t * n)
