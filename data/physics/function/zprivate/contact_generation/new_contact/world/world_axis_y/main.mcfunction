# Calculate Penetration Depth, Contact Normal, Contact Point & Separating Velocity
    # Penetration Depth
    # (Important): For point-face collisions, the penetration depth is the projection of (point - <any point on the face>) onto the contact normal. It's distributive, so I can also subtract the projection of any point on the face from the (already calculated) projection of the corner.
    # (Important): Calculations are done in "get_corner/..." to avoid redundant score checks and to utilize "return run".

    # Contact Normal
    # (Important): For point-face collisions, the contact normal is the face's normal. So it's the axis of minimum overlap.

    # Contact Point
    # (Important): For point-face collisions, the contact point is the point projected onto the surface (= moved along contact normal with the penetration depth as the amount).
    # (Important): I use the "execute store" from earlier to avoid an additional scoreboard call. Also, the point's coordinates are copied over in "get_corner/...".

    # Separating Velocity
    # (Important): The separating velocity is the dot product between the contact point's relative velocity and the contact normal. The relative velocity is the cross product between the angular velocity and the contact point (relative to the object's center) that's added together with the object's linear velocity.
    # (Important): Because the static object is now the one with the face, the result of the separating velocity is inverted.

        # Calculate cross product between angular velocity and relative contact point
        # (Important): I overwrite the contact point scores here, as I don't need them anymore after this.
        # (Important): I messed up the order (relativeContactPoint x angularVelocity instead of angularVelocity x relativeContactPoint). To accomodate for that without spending hours rewriting it, I divide by -1000 instead of 1000.
        # (Important): Although I only need a single component for the separating velocity, I still need the full ContactVelocity vector to calculate the impulse (because of friction).
        # (Important): For world_axis_? ONLY: ContactVelocity is A - B, so I keep the calculations inverted, so that projecting ContactVelocity onto the ContactNormal gives the SeparatingVelocity directly.
