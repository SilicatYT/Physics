# Calculate contact data
    # Penetration Depth
    # (Important): The calculations are done in "get_edge_b".

    # Contact Point
    # (Important): The contact point is the center of the shortest connecting line between the two edges.
    # (Important): Calculation: Work with the edges as line definitions (starting point + variable * directional vector). Define the "squared distance" function and find its minimum (it's the only critical point, so setting the 1st derivative of the function to 0 is enough). I only calculate s for one edge, as I'm pretty sure it's guaranteed to correspond to a point that's within the edge's bounds. So I don't need a fallback for "If s is out of bounds, do the same for the other edge".
    # (Important): Edge1 = <Corner on the negative end> + s * <Corner on the positive end> => (u + s * v)    //    Edge2 = <Corner on the negative end> + t * <Corner on the positive end> => (m + t * n)
    # (Important): The direction is either the object's axis (Already stored) or 1 along that axis (For world blocks). Because I use 1 instead of 1,000, I have to be aware of the scaling.
        # Calculate intermediate results (Dot products)
            # A = v * v
            # (Important): As the object's axes are normalized, this is always 1.

            # B = n * n
            # (Important): As the block is axis-aligned, this is defined as 1.

            # C = v * n
            # (Important): Because the block is axis-aligned, its edge's directional vector only has one component that is also 1. So C is the same as that component from ObjectA's axis, which is the x component in this case.

            # D = v * (u - m)
            # (Important): Value1-3 are the three components of (u - m), as calculated in the "get_edge_?" functions.
            # (Important): Because I only need to keep the x component of (u - m) for the calculation of E, I can overwrite the other 2 components to save 2 scoreboard operations.
            # (Important): I need the numerator for s and t to be scaled 1,000x higher than the denominator. So keeping D scaled by 1,000x too much saves a few operations.
