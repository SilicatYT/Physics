The contact normal will always point from A to B. PenetrationDepth is A - B, and is inverted if needed (if ObjectA's min projection onto the cross product axis is equal to the edge's projection). The contact normal is inverted under the same condition. ContactVelocity is always B - A, so that projecting it onto the contact normal always yields the correct sign without having to invert it manually.
