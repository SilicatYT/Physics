# Calculate effective mass along the three orthonormal axes (InverseMass + (RelativeContactPos x Axis) * (InverseInertiaTensorGlobal * (RelativeContactPos x Axis))))
# (Important): RelativeContactPos x Axis = a   |   InverseInertiaTensorGlobal * a = b   |   a * b = c   |   InverseMass + c = EffectiveMass
# (Important): For world_axis_?, the effective mass calculations are scaled up just enough so that InverseMass can be added to it without needing to scale it down. The calculations don't overflow for reasonable numbers. The scaling is different from non-axis-aligned contact normals.
