# Calculate DeltaVelocity (Desired velocity change along the contact normal)
# (Important): -(1 + RestitutionCoefficient) * SeparatingVelocity
# (Important): DeltaVelocity is scaled up by 1,000x * 100x = 100,000x. I scale it up to 100,000,000x at the end so it has the same scaling as EffectiveMass. It should not overflow.

# Calculate orthonormal basis
# (Important): The orthonormal basis is a 3x3 matrix. The first column is the contact normal, the 2nd and 3rd columns are tangents.
# (Important): For axis-aligned contact normals like here, this is trivial, so I just directly incorporate it into subsequent formulas for performance reasons. Here, it's: [[Â±1.0, 0.0, 0.0],[0.0, 1.0, 0.0],[0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]

# Transform ContactVelocity from world space to contact space
# (Important): To avoid matrix multiplication, I instead do: ContactVelocity.<x/y/z> = ContactVelocity * <respective column of orthonormal basis> (Dot product)
# (Important): Here, the ContactVelocity is already in contact space.

# Calculate effective mass along the 3 contact axes (3 columns of the orthonormal basis)
# (Important): Because the effective mass stays the same if the contact normal doesn't change, I only calculate it once per tick for each contact.
