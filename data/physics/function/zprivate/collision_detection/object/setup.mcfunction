# (Important): If no blocks appeared in the world AABB checks, and I therefore only run the setup after world contact generation would've happened, I can skip all the world preparations and speed up things a lot.
scoreboard players set #Physics.SetupDone Physics 1

# Prepare scores for object-object collision detection & contact generation
# (Important): #Physics.ThisObject Physics.Object.Axis.?.? are set at the start of this function, inside the "execute store result", to squeeze out an extra bit of performance
# (Important): This runs before object-object collision detection happens in this function, because this lets me use a #-fakeplayer instead of using @s, making these accesses (even during world contact generation!) roughly 10% faster. Technically I only *need* those scores after everything related to world contacts is already 100% complete, so any #Physics.ThisObject reference that happens during this function or during world contact stuff is purely because of that.
# (Important): Object.ID is set above to avoid an extra "scoreboard players get".
