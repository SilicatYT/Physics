# Prepare the contacts storage & copy over this object's stored contacts from the previous tick (If there are any)
# (Important): The ID in the data storage is also used when generating the new contact
# (Important): I use a placeholder "MinSeparatingVelocity" so it doesn't get selected during resolution and is immediately replaced when a contact is found / updated.
# (Important): With at least 2 contacts that refresh the MinSeparatingVelocity for the current object, only refreshing the score and then at the very end copying it into the storage once is faster than always refreshing the storage. Thanks to accumulation, this will basically be guaranteed.

# Check for coarse collisions with other dynamic objects, so I can then perform the SAT to check for fine collisions
# (Important): Only checks objects in a range of 6.929 blocks, which is the sum of both objects' maximum supported bounding box divided by 2 (so from the center of both entities), assuming I cap the dimensions at 4 blocks. The reasoning is explained in the set_attributes/dimension function.
# (Important): A Physics.Checked tag could remain for the object if the contact resolution moved it into an unloaded chunk, which could cause resolution issues for 1 tick upon getting loaded again (very minor and rare issues). This alone wouldn't warrant a change, but using a timestamp score I can also get rid of the "tag @e[...] remove ...". The performance difference is negligible, but with a lot of item displays, a timestamp is faster ontop of being more stable, especially given that inactive physics objects would've still counted toward the entity cap and made the @e call slower.
