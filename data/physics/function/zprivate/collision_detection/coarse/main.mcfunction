# Iterate through every minecraft block that intersects with the interaction entity's hitbox (AABB), so I can then perform the Separating Axes Theorem (SAT) to check for fine collisions
# (Important): I only have the global coords for the bounding box, so instead of using a few scoreboard commands, I just don't use relative coordinates here. If I do need the relative coordinates later, I will change that

# Check for coarse collisions with other dynamic objects, so I can then perform the SAT to check for fine collisions
# (Important): Only checks objects in a range of 26.5 blocks. This means that the maximum size an object can have is restricted to a max side length of 15.3 blocks. The max size should probably be reduced even further though.
