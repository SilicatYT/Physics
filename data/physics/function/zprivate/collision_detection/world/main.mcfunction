# Iterate through every single voxel that collides with the object's AABB
# Note: I could remove the $(Offset), but it would mean that either ~ or ~<StepCount> for any axis could be outside the bounding box, instead of only ~<StepCount>. This would require lots of score checks, even if it would make it cache a lot more. I don't think it's worth it, especially considering larger objects where the number of extra score checks would dramatically increase.
