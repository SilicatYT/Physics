# THIS SHEET IS UPDATED WHENEVER A NEW CALCULATION REQUIRES ME TO DOWNSCALE, OR WHEN A HIGHER SCALE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THE PRECISION IS LOST ANYWAY BECAUSE OF INTERMEDIATE CALCULATIONS
- Position is scaled by 1,000x
- Velocity is scaled by 10,000,000x and given in blocks/tick
- Acceleration is scaled by 10,000,000x and given in blocks/tick^2 (Includes gravity and its default value)
- InverseMass is scaled by 100,000,000/x and calculated with in 1/kg (x=1 would be 100g)
- InverseInertiaTensorLocal is scaled by 1,000,000,000/x (x is a regularly scaled tensor value, like 166 for a cube) (Could reach values like 1,000,000,000/668,333 = 1496, or also 60,000,000)
- Dimension is scaled by 10,000x
