# DISCLAIMER:
- Only single-cube hitboxes are supported, so multi-box blocks are assigned the closest matching tag (Example: Stairs would be in full_block) or are handled individually.
- Blocks that have unique hitboxes are handled separately. If a multi-box block's hitbox can be approximated with a unique hitbox, it will also be handled separately.

no_hitbox: Contains all blocks that never have a hitbox
full_block: Contains all blocks that are always a full cube
slab: Contains all slabs
block_state_dependent: Contains all blocks whose hitbox depends on the block state (Except slabs, those are simple enough with only 3 options)
	glass_pane: Contains all glass panes
	fence: Contains all fences
	fence_gate: Contains all fence gates
	wall: Contains all walls
	door: Contains all doors
	trap_door: Contains all trapdoors
	head: Contains all heads except dragon heads
